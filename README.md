# -Test-Automation-of-MPPT-Solar-Charge-Controller

The main objective of this project is to make the testing procedure of a solar charge controller automated. MPPT stands for Maximum Power Point Tracking. It is a device used in solar energy systems to optimize the efficiency of charging batteries with solar panels. It also saves load and batteries keeping the system in ideal operating voltage range. There are some tests of this controller to be sure that the controller is working properly or not. Typically, these tests are done manually. By this project, we have been able to implement the tests automatedly. We have used voltage and current sensors to measure the parameters, relay has been used for maintaining the testing sequence and connections. Also two motors were set up for controlling the voltage source knob. An Arduino nano was used for controlling the whole system.
